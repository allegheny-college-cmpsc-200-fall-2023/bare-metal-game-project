# Project: General report

As a reminder, this course explores four (4) major learning outcomes. For sake of convenience, they are:

* Explain how programs written in high-level computer programming languages execute using lower-level computer circuitry
* Identify levels of the Memory Hierarchy and the implications of using the various levels to implement high-performance programs
* Develop C and Assembly language programs which use the appropriate levels of the Memory Hierarchy and processor registers to create performant, executable programs and arithmetic logic units
* Describe and use parallel processing techniques to increase a programâ€™s performance and efficiency

## Describe the ways that this project addressed the four learning outcomes. Give examples of portions of your program that fulfill each.
